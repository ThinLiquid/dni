# byf
- I'm a minor, so keep that in mind when interacting !! I'm also not very comfortable with ppl over 25 interacting with me :/
- I also swear a LOT and my art features a lot of it too, lmk if you don't want me to swear when interacting with ya, it's no problem :D
- My art also features some VERY small sexual jokes (like haha booby haha pp), but no outright nsfw (ew), as I'm ace and find sex to be a joke and occasionally get genuinely surprised when I remember it's a real thing. The same goes for some drug related content, though it's usually limited to bad weed jokes
- I often have a hard time figuring out what people mean, so please be clear heh
- I tend to forget putting warnings on my characters, and while I am in the middle of fixing that, just be warned!
- I use tone indicators sometimes! If you don't like tone indicators i'll try not to use em when interacting, just tell me first <3
- I often upload a lot of pictures at a time (mostly old art when I find it) In the same vein as that, sometimes I go a while without drawing. 
That's because I'm busy a lot, plus sometimes it's a little hard on my arm/wrist/back.
- I am currently hyperfixated on Omori! If you are not okay with me talking about it, please let me know! I completely understand if the themes aren't for all.
- I am okay with offers on almost all of my OC's, even if they aren't in the UFT folder. Check the description of the folder a character is in if you are interested in offering!
- I type “professionally” most of the time. 
- I am a busy man with a lot of outside responsibilities. If you always expect a response to comments left on my page or characters then please do not comment at all, it’s likely I won’t reply for a while/at all (especially if you left an offer that isn’t what I’m looking for).
- I don’t usually use tone indicators. I would prefer you not use tone indicators when speaking to me unless your tone is legitimately unclear. I find them infantilizing.
- I don’t do pings on my characters. If you ask for a ping you will get your comment deleted, and may be blocked.
- I use the word "femboy" to describe myself AND my ocs btw, if you're uncomfortable with me using that word to describe your ocs please do said so ! I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
- Don't put my NFS/NFO characters in your dreamie folders, unless decision changes, i will never give them away.
- Don't compare my characters or tell me my characters are similar to any other characters please. i am literally begging you.
- Do not attempt to befriend me in any ways if you're a minor, interacting/following/commenting/favorite is fine but wanting to be friends is off limit. I'm just not comfortable with minors. (unless we've been friends before/you're here for my adopts)
- Don't send NSFW to me without asking me first, it's weird and makes me uncomfortable so don't do that.
- I do not censor anything on my profile. 
- My art can contain, blood, gore, suggestive themes, open self-harm, artistic nudity, etc. My art is for a mature audience so please only interact if you’re not bothered seeing those subjects.
- I block people easily when uncomfortable. I am willing to explain sometimes but for the vast majority of the time I can't explain any more than other than 'personal reasons'! most of the time it's due to my anxiety and/or triggers being touched! sometimes even someone having a single character with themes I am uncomfy with can make me block them.
- in conversation/chats/dms, I may request a topic change or an image/gif be removed from the chat! please listen to this ^^'
- I prefer short conversations (it's an anxiety thing), so don't be offended if I say I have to go and you see me active somewhere else.
- I default to they/them if I am unsure of pronouns! I correct myself/change once I am aware of pronouns, but if the they/them default is something that upsets you it's best you don't follow/interact!!
- generally I don't require tone indicators but they are nice to have sometimes! ^^ so if you like to use them, feel free to continue with me, but if you don't use them, don't worry about using them!
- I don't enjoy jokes that make fun of people/me, even if they're 'friendly' mocking or 'friendly' name calling. please don't use them around me! ^^"
- I get anxiety around watermarks/credit! I like my work to be watermarked and credited so please understand if I don't want to send an unwatermarked or dm asking for credit somewhere.

# joke dni
j DNI is pretty straightforward, DNI if u pray to the ancient gods to rain hellfire upon this world of sin, DNI if ur cursed by the amulet (annoying af), DNI if ur just here to bug me about the prophecy like I get it I gotta save the world but can't u have a little me time Jesus fuck

- if you change your pfp/icon to something related to anything on the list below, I may stop talking to you/interacting with you until you change it- I won't ask for you to change it cos like-- it's up to you, but if it makes me uncomfortable I'll probs stay away ^^'
