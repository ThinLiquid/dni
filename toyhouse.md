- I also swear a LOT and my art features a lot of it too, lmk if you don't want me to swear when interacting with ya, it's no problem :D
- My art also features some VERY small sexual jokes (like haha booby haha pp), but no outright nsfw (ew), as I'm ace and find sex to be a joke and occasionally get genuinely surprised when I remember it's a real thing. The same goes for some drug related content, though it's usually limited to bad weed jokes
- I often have a hard time figuring out what people mean, so please be clear heh
- I tend to forget putting warnings on my characters, and while I am in the middle of fixing that, just be warned!
- I use tone indicators sometimes! If you don't like tone indicators i'll try not to use em when interacting, just tell me first <3
- I often upload a lot of pictures at a time (mostly old art when I find it) In the same vein as that, sometimes I go a while without drawing. 
That's because I'm busy a lot, plus sometimes it's a little hard on my arm/wrist/back.
- I am currently hyperfixated on Omori! If you are not okay with me talking about it, please let me know! I completely understand if the themes aren't for all.

- I am a busy man with a lot of outside responsibilities. If you always expect a response to comments left on my page or characters then please do not comment at all, it’s likely I won’t reply for a while/at all (especially if you left an offer that isn’t what I’m looking for).
- I don’t usually use tone indicators. I would prefer you not use tone indicators when speaking to me unless your tone is legitimately unclear. I find them infantilizing.
- I don’t do pings on my characters. If you ask for a ping you will get your comment deleted, and may be blocked.

- Don't put my NFS/NFO characters in your dreamie folders, unless decision changes, i will never give them away.
- Don't compare my characters or tell me my characters are similar to any other characters please. i am literally begging you.
- Do not attempt to befriend me in any ways if you're a minor, interacting/following/commenting/favorite is fine but wanting to be friends is off limit. I'm just not comfortable with minors. (unless we've been friends before/you're here for my adopts)
- Don't send NSFW to me without asking me first, it's weird and makes me uncomfortable so don't do that.

- My art can contain, blood, gore, suggestive themes, open self-harm, artistic nudity, etc. My art is for a mature audience so please only interact if you’re not bothered seeing those subjects.
- I block people easily when uncomfortable. I am willing to explain sometimes but for the vast majority of the time I can't explain any more than other than 'personal reasons'! most of the time it's due to my anxiety and/or triggers being touched! sometimes even someone having a single character with themes I am uncomfy with can make me block them.
- in conversation/chats/dms, I may request a topic change or an image/gif be removed from the chat! please listen to this ^^'
- I prefer short conversations (it's an anxiety thing), so don't be offended if I say I have to go and you see me active somewhere else.
- I default to they/them if I am unsure of pronouns! I correct myself/change once I am aware of pronouns, but if the they/them default is something that upsets you it's best you don't follow/interact!!
- generally I don't require tone indicators but they are nice to have sometimes! ^^ so if you like to use them, feel free to continue with me, but if you don't use them, don't worry about using them!
- I don't enjoy jokes that make fun of people/me, even if they're 'friendly' mocking or 'friendly' name calling. please don't use them around me! ^^"
- I get anxiety around watermarks/credit! I like my work to be watermarked and credited so please understand if I don't want to send an unwatermarked or dm asking for credit somewhere.
- if you change your pfp/icon to something related to anything on the list below, I may stop talking to you/interacting with you until you change it- I won't ask for you to change it cos like-- it's up to you, but if it makes me uncomfortable I'll probs stay away ^^'
